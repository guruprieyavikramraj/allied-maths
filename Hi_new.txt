Here’s a basic GitHub workflow (Git flow) that outlines how to manage a project using Git and GitHub, especially useful for beginners:

🔁 Basic GitHub Workflow
✅ 1. Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub

Click "New Repository"

Name your repo (e.g., saree-optimization)

Choose Public or Private

Initialize with README.md (optional)

🖥️ 2. Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
📂 3. Make Changes Locally
Open the folder

Add or edit your files (e.g., Python code, LaTeX, datasets)

➕ 4. Stage the Changes
git add .
This adds all modified files to the staging area.

💬 5. Commit the Changes
git commit -m "Add initial optimization model"
A meaningful commit message helps others understand your change.

⬆️ 6. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
(Use main or master, depending on your repo's default branch)

🔃 7. Pull Latest Changes (if team project)
git pull origin main
Always pull before you start making changes if you're working in a team.

🌿 Optional: Use Branches for Features
git checkout -b feature/branch-name
Make changes → Commit → Push → Create a Pull Request on GitHub

✅ Summary Flow
# One-time
git clone repo-url

# For every change
git pull
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
Let me know if you want this as a handout or visual diagram.
